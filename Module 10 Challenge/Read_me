Module 10 Challenge: Crypto Clustering
This repository contains the solution to the Module 10 Challenge: Crypto Clustering. The aim of this challenge is to combine financial Python programming skills with unsupervised learning skills to cluster cryptocurrencies using K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The repository contains the following files:

crypto_clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for importing and preparing the data, clustering the cryptocurrencies with K-Means using the original data and PCA data, and visualizing and comparing the results.

Resources/crypto_market_data.csv: CSV file containing the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

To run the code, you will need to have Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, and the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Scikit-learn
hvPlot
Pathlib
Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the cloned repository.

Open the crypto_clustering.ipynb file.

Run each cell in the notebook to see the output and results.

Note that some cells may take a few minutes to run due to the size of the dataset.
